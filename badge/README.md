Ruxcon HHV 2017 Badge code

This code has been tested against a NodeMCU build with the following modules included;
adc,bit,crypto,file,gpio,net,node,tmr,uart,wifi,ws2812

These are not all being used in the code but I'm too lazy to figure out which modules I'm actually using.

You can perform custom NodeMCU builds here;

There's also an included nodemcu binary in the NodeMCU directory.
